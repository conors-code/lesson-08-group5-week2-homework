# Based on the Sample Hardhat Project

Group 5 Week 2: Group homework
Add Scripts and tests to the Sample Hardhat Project, to implement:
- voting rights,
- casting votes,
- delegating votes (and)
- querying results
These scripts should not have a dependency on hardhat.

Note that contracts/Ballot.sol is *not* my work; it came from the hardhat base project 

# Base project was:
This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
